    "Our computation resources have increased with multiple machines where each machine have multiple GPUs. Training a neural network on only 1 GPU does not make full use of our hardwares. In this note we will understand the mechanism of training on multiple gpus. The information across the internet is not complete, instead just copy paste the code to make things work, it is more important to understand what's happening behind the scene. In this way we can also get in touch with multiprocessing, which may also help to speedup scientific research.\n",

The basic idea of parallel programming is to distribute tasks to the cores, so that we can make full use of the computation power. This is actually an extremely complicated topic and many weird things might happen. The goal of this note is to provide basic concepts and terminologies, for a deeper understanding you may just search online or take a look at the book __**Modern Operating Systems**__."

[This folder](demos/speed_test_mp_thread) contains two test file to create 5000 threads or processes. Create threads takes about 0.3s, but create processes takes about 13s, this is a huge difference. For the purpose of parallel programming we can always create processes instead threads since we know a process contains threads. However, considering the efficiency of creation and memory usage, we should know what exact is the difference between them and use the right one at the right time.\n",
